# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
(Game: play a tic-tac-toe game) In a game of tic-tac-toe, two players take turns marking an available cell in a 3 * 3 grid with their respective tokens (either X or O). When one player has placed three tokens in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on the grid, the game is over and that player has won. A draw (no winner) occurs when all the cells on the grid have been filled with tokens and neither player has achieved a win. Create a program for playing a tic-tac-toe game.  The program prompts two players to alternately enter an X token and O token. Whenever a token is entered, the program redisplays the board on the console and determines the status of the game (win, draw, or continue)
